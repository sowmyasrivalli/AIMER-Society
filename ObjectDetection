Object Detection Using Roboflow
Project Overview:
The Object Detection project aimed to detect and localize objects within images, identifying their exact positions using bounding boxes.

Steps Involved:
1.Data Collection:
Curated a diverse dataset of images containing various objects such as cars, people, and traffic signs.
Used Roboflow’s annotation tool to manually label the objects in each image by drawing bounding boxes around them.

2.Data Preprocessing:
Applied data augmentation techniques like horizontal flipping, brightness adjustment, and scaling to increase dataset variability and model robustness.
Converted images and annotations into the format required for training object detection models (e.g., COCO JSON format).

3.Model Training:
Utilized Roboflow’s platform to build and train object detection models using popular architectures like YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN 
(Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks).
Fine-tuned hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and IoU threshold to optimize detection performance.

4.Model Evaluation:
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP), Precision-Recall curves, and Intersection over Union (IoU).
Analyzed false positives and false negatives to iteratively refine the model.

5.Deployment:
Deployed the trained model in a Python-based application that could process real-time video streams, detecting and tracking objects in each frame.
Integrated the model into a simple GUI using Tkinter, allowing users to upload videos and see object detection in action.

Technical Stack:
Roboflow for annotation and model training
YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN for object detection
OpenCV for video processing
Python (Tkinter) for creating the user interface

Key Learnings:
Developed an in-depth understanding of object detection algorithms and their application in real-time scenarios.
Improved skills in data annotation and understanding the importance of high-quality labeled data.
Learned how to deploy object detection models in real-world applications, handling the challenges of video processing.
